# Stripe Home Page Replica

This project aims to clone the home page of the [Stripe home page](https://stripe.com)

Currently, working on the feature of Modular solutions section, really cool animations with svg. Each animation is not hard but the total orchestration requires a lot of work, and for that purpose I decided to use [GSAP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gsap) animation library.

```bash
#start development
npm run dev

#produce production build
npm run build
```

## GSAP

This animation library is really useful for creating complex animations, which is almost impossible to create with plain css.
